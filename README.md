# Credit Card Fraud Detection  

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and their customers. With the growing number of transactions happening daily, the risk of fraudulent activities is also rising. The key challenge lies in detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time while minimizing false positives.  

This project leverages **machine learning algorithms** to automatically detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
The main objective is to develop a **machine learning model** that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false positives. The model will be trained on historical transaction data to learn patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent behavior.

## ðŸ›  Methodology  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather credit card transaction data, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.  
   - Use publicly available datasets from **Kaggle** or **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Remove missing or irrelevant information.  
   - Perform **feature engineering** to create new features that improve model performance.  

3. **Model Selection**  
   - Evaluate multiple algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Neural Networks**.  
   - Select the best-performing model for fraud detection.  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Train the selected model on preprocessed data.  
   - Use techniques such as **cross-validation** to avoid overfitting.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assess performance using **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and **Accuracy**.  
   - Plot **ROC curves** and compare with other state-of-the-art models.  

6. **Expected Outcomes**  
   - A **highly accurate model** capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with minimal false positives.  
   - Aid financial institutions in preventing financial losses and protecting customers from fraud.

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results  
The resulting model will:  
- Detect fraudulent transactions with **high accuracy**.  
- Minimize **false positives** to reduce unnecessary alerts.  
- Provide a scalable and deployable solution for financial institutions.
